# 🎯  CLIP-playground: Experiments with Contrastive Language–Image Pretraining

Welcome to the  CLIP-playground— a curated set of hands-on experiments and tutorials around OpenAI's [CLIP](https://openai.com/index/clip) model. From zero-shot magic to architectural breakdowns and fine-tuning — this repo documents the full journey. 🚀

## 📌 What’s Inside

| Blog Day | Experiment | Description |
|----------|------------|-------------|
| Day 6    | `clip_inference.ipynb` | Load pretrained CLIP, encode text & images, and perform zero-shot classification. Includes similarity visualizations. |
| Day 7    | `clip_architecture.ipynb` | Dive into the internals of CLIP — ViT encoders, embedding spaces, and training strategies. *(Coming soon!)*|
| Day 8    | `clip_finetune.ipynb` | Fine-tune CLIP on your own custom dataset and explore task-specific improvements. *(Coming soon!)* |

## 🧠 About CLIP

CLIP (Contrastive Language–Image Pretraining) is a multimodal model by OpenAI that learns to match images and text in a shared embedding space, enabling zero-shot recognition, search, and understanding.
